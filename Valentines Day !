   <h1><strong>Valentines Special</strong></h1></body>
  <p><h6>For my baby, Audrey Tlou</h6></p>
<body><h2>HER SOUL</h2></body>
<body><h4><em>Her beauty is magnetic<br>
    and it draws me in some more,<br>
    the call of lust is knocking <br>
    But I won't go to the door,<br>
    <br>
    Because I know one to love is what she's looking for <br>
    but her distance towards me is hard to ignore,<br>
    More and more she show me there is a mystery to explore<br>
    So I ask of you again what are you in it for,<br>
    <br>
    You say that your not here for all the glams and galore<br>
    but eventually with time I know you'll be wanting more and more<br>
    <br>
    you always reassure me as I try to restore<br>
    for your love drives me crazy like an addict at a crackhouse store,<br>
    and with that gushing feeling I try to ignore<br>
    all that has happened before.
